Hello! My name is Blair Cliff, and I'm the Quartermaster for USS Sequoia. I'm from Napa, and have lived in or near it for all of my life. I'm a college dropout, having found more success in my career with the State of California. Over 12 years ago, my life was completely flipped on its head, when I met my partner Jocelyn Cliff, and we've been happily married for over 6 years. The way I came to The Fleet was pretty convoluted - 15 years ago, when I was a Medical Transcriptionist, I had a coworker who introduced me to her son, who became my roommate for a time, and her daughters, one of whom was Joanne Powers, first officer of the USS Artesia. Near the beginning of the pandemic, Joanne invited my wife and I to join the Artesia, and we've both been active members since. I have a lifelong love of video games, board games, and roleplaying, but I also dabble in a variety of crafts and interests, such as miniature painting and hot sauce brewing. I've always had an affinity for computers, which formed the foundation for my work as a Data Management Supervisor at the local mental hospital.
