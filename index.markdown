# USS Sequoia NCC-1103
## Serving Star Trek fans in the greater San Francisco Area

### Welcome to the USS Sequoia, a chapter of [The Fleet](https://startrekthefleet.weebly.com/). 
We are a social club for people in the greater San Francisco Bay Area who enjoy Star Trek, cosplay, and costume making. We meet up together both in and out of costume to take photos, see movies, work on projects together, sightseeing, and more. Our ship is a Sombra class vessel, set in the same time period as Strange New Worlds, so our coordinated uniforms and costumes are contemporary with that era of Star Trek. However, we enjoy and discuss all eras, so please come join us no matter which trek is your personal favorite!
