# USS Sequoia NCC-1103
## Serving Star Trek fans in the greater San Francisco Area

### Welcome to the USS Sequoia, a chapter of [The Fleet](https://startrekthefleet.weebly.com/). 
Hello there, friends!
The USS Sequoia is one of many new ships launching this year in The Fleet. She is a Sombra class themed as Strange New Worlds, so all of our uniforms and costuming will be from that era. Fun!
