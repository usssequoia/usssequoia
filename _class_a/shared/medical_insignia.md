#### Requirement(s):
* A Starfleet delta

#### Optional:
* The sciences symbol should be embossed into the delta.
* The insignia should be gold-colored with a silver-colored border.
* Some vendors sell an insignia with a medical cross embossed. Although these badges are allowed, they are not screen accurate and not recommended. Wearing an insignia with a red cross is highly discouraged.
