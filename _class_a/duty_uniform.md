{% include_relative /shared/top_basics.md %}
* Curved princess seams running up the back
* Some screen-used uniforms have a modified collar in three parts, held together with velcro and hidden zippers in the shoulders, to allow actors in heavy makeup to easily don and doff their shirts without needing to redo the makeup

#### Vendor(s):
* [Cosermart](https://cosermart.com/collections/star-trek-1/products/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-captain-pike-gold-uniforms-startfleet-blue-red-yellow-top-shirts)
    * There are some problems with the Cosermart uniforms in terms of screen accuracy, but these are the easiest uniform tops to get.
* [TrekCosplay](https://trekcosplay.com/snw/)
    * The quality is approximately the same as Cosermart; however, if you provide your measurements, they will produce a custom-sized uniform.
