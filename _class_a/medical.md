This uniform is typically reserved for members who are in the Medical division. However, this is not a strict restriction.

## Uniform Top
#### Requirement(s):
* A double-breasted light blue tunic

#### Optional:
{% include_relative /shared/sleeve_detail.md %}

#### Vendor(s):
* [Cosermart](https://www.ebay.com/itm/134879703602)
    * Cosermart does not stock the top anymore, so it needs to be acquired through a third party.
