title: Uniform Guidelines
permalink: /uniforms/

---

Each chapter of The Fleet represents a different uniform style within the Starfleet side of the Star Trek Multiverse. The crew of the U.S.S. Sequoia has chosen the style of the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds uniform to represent their ship. 

Even though costuming is one of our club's core values, it is not required to have or wear a uniform to join our Fleet or participate in most events (excluding rare events that specifically call for a uniform). However, ownership of a uniform that meets the listed standard is required to be promoted along the Commissioned Officer track (see: Rank). Members who do not own such a uniform are still eligible to be promoted along the Enlisted track.

The Fleet, USS Sequoia, and its members are not sponsored or endorsed by any of the vendors listed in the following guidelines, nor does The Fleet or USS Sequoia necessarily endorse any of the listed vendors or the quality of the product.  We are only providing an option for our members to obtain an item of consistent quality to build their uniform.  Should you have any questions, please reach out to the ship's Quartermaster, any of the ship's Executive Team, or use the Contact Us link on this site.

Uniforms come in two classes, with variants. Class A uniforms are replications of uniforms seen in Strange New Worlds. Class B uniforms are casual t-shirts designed to be consistent amongst crew members and represent the ship and/or The Fleet. Events that require a uniform will specify which uniform class and/or variant are required or recommended.

Due to variation in vendors and in home-fabricated uniforms, there will be some aspects of the uniforms that are marked as requirements. Uniforms that do not match these aspects will not be considered a qualifying uniform for the purposes of promotion and uniform-only events. Other aspects will be marked as being optional. These traits are recommended in order to strive towards a screen-accurate uniform (a uniform that matches details seen in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds), but due to various factors may be infeasible to require amongst all uniforms.

### Class A 
In addition to the Standard Duty Uniform (which is the recommended uniform), there are eight identified variants that may be situationally appropriate for a costumed event based on Rank, Division, and other factors.
{% for uniform_a in site.class_a %}
  <div class="grid__item">
      <h2><a href="{{ uniform_a.url }}"> {{ uniform_a.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ uniform_a.excerpt }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
<div style="clear:left" />

### Class B
Class B uniforms are more casual articles of clothing, which may be used in situations where it might not be advisable or preferrable to wear a Class A uniform (e.g. outdoors in warm weather). They all take the form of basic t-shirts in various styles.

{% for uniform_b in site.class_b %}
  <div class="grid__item">
      <h2><a href="{{ uniform_b.url }}"> {{ uniform_b.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ uniform_b.excerpt }}
  </div>
{% endfor %}
