## About Us:

We are a social club for people in the greater San Francisco Bay Area who enjoy 
Star Trek, cosplay, and costume making. We meet up together both in and out of 
costume to take photos, see movies, work on projects together, sightseeing, and 
more. Our ship is a Sombra class vessel, set in the same time period as Strange 
New Worlds, so our coordinated uniforms and costumes are contemporary with that 
era of Star Trek. However, we enjoy and discuss all eras, so please come join 
us no matter which trek is your personal favorite!

## About THE FLEET

![THE FLEET logo: the words "The Fleet" followed by "A Star Trek Costuming Fan Group". A rainbow is behind both bits of text, with three colors, each color respectively labeled after the three pillars of the group: costuming, fandom, and charity](/assets/images/the-fleet-logo-01.png)

Covering ALL eras of the Star Trek franchise, THE FLEET is a growing fan organization that focuses on costuming, giving back to the community through volunteer work with different charity organizations, and most importantly, having fun!

*"Boldly venturing through the frontiers of costuming, fandom, and charity."*
